            <h2>Who was Aaron Swartz?</h2>
            <p>Aaron Swartz was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist.</p>
            <h2>What was he known for?</h2>
            <p>Swartz was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS, the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons, the website framework web.py, and was a co-founder of the social news site Reddit.</p>
            <h2>What happened to him?</h2>
            <p>Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release. Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself.</p>
            <h2>What was the issue with the criminal case against him?</h2>
            <p>The issue many people had with the case was the FBI clearly wanted to make an example out of him to discourage future crimes of similar nature. Allegedly, his parents were even told that by the FBI. The charges and sentence he was facing were not justified relative to his crimes. No one knew what he was planning to do with the data so there was no way to prove that anything malicious would be done, and no damage was done to anyone or anything. He simply used a program to mass download a database of academic papers that were behind a paywall and for that the FBI were willing to destroy his life to use him as an example. He had done something similar in the past and all he did with the data was analyze it for research. Taking that into consideration it's reasonable to assume that was what he was going to do again, not something ill-intentioned like selling it or making his own for profit website. Both JSTOR and MIT did nothing to help stop the FBI, they wanted to remain neutral and said it was up to FBI to decide the case.  </p>
